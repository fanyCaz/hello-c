# Learning C

So here is where I'm writing the exercises or things I learn from the book "the C Programming Language" by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie.

Honestly, I'm not doing *every* exercise, but the ones I consider will help me understand better how the hell you program in C aka the ones that I struggle with doing. This also means, I'll do basically everything but not in order.

## Map of this repo

I'm making a file per chapter, maybe not the best way, but this is how I can write notes as comments and get fast reminders of the things I've been learning in that chapter, this is the way I learn best.
Basically, the name of the chapter is in the name of the file.

## Motivation (?)

This is the first time (unbelievable) that I pick a book to learn how to program, all my life (as programmer) I always look for docs I care about and error messages in google, so that is not very convenient when I try to finish a project.

This may be the first time I can finish a side project without freaking out that I have it.

Yes, finishing a book is a project even when "is not a real thing", anyway, is hard.
